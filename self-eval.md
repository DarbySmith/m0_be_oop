# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
    * I found this lesson very overwhelming. It took me very long and I still do not feel confident about it.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
    * This lesson took me several hours I feel very behind after doing it. I felt very frustrated at many points during this lesson trying to troubleshoot my problems and understand how to approach the questions.

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
    * I need to practice the concepts that were encompassed within this lesson more and I need to know when to ask for help. I struggle asking for help. I always want to solve things on my own, but I need to lean on my group more and reach out when I am really struggling.
